# Karuna: A Transparent Charity Dapp

**Karuna (‡§ï‡§∞‡•Å‡§£‡§æ)** is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Stacks blockchain. Its mission is to bring trust and transparency to charitable giving by leveraging the immutable and public nature of blockchain technology.

The name "Karuna" is a Sanskrit word meaning compassion and mercy, reflecting the project's core values.

## üåü Project Overview

Karuna addresses the opacity in charitable donations. By operating on the Stacks blockchain, every donation is recorded as a public, verifiable, and permanent transaction. Donors can see exactly where their contributions are going, and organizations can prove that funds were received and properly accounted for.

---

## 2. Project Description

Karuna allows users to donate to specific projects, with every transaction recorded on the immutable and public ledger of the Stacks Testnet. This ensures that the flow of funds is completely traceable and verifiable by anyone.

## 3. Project Vision

The vision for Karuna is to create a charity ecosystem where donors have complete confidence that their contributions reach their intended purpose. By eliminating the need for a central trusted third party and providing a public record of all transactions, Karuna aims to:

- Combat fraud  
- Reduce administrative overhead  
- Increase public trust in charitable organizations

## ‚ú® Features

- **Transparent Donations:** All donations are recorded on the Stacks Testnet, making them publicly visible and immutable.  
- **Traceable Funds:** Funds are sent directly from the donor's wallet to a designated address, eliminating intermediaries.  
- **Live Project Status:** Anyone can view the total amount raised for any project by querying the smart contract, ensuring real-time transparency.

## 4. Future Scope

- **Beneficiary Verification:** Implement a system to verify the identity of beneficiaries on-chain using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).  
- **Milestone-Based Funding:** Use smart contracts to release funds to projects only when specific, verifiable milestones are met.  
- **DAO Governance:** Allow donors to participate in a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to vote on which projects receive funding.  
- **Integration with Real-World Assets:** Partner with physical stores or service providers to allow beneficiaries to redeem aid using a token.
