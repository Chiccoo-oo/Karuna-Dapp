## üåü Project Overview

Karuna addresses the opacity in charitable donations. By operating on the Stacks blockchain, every donation is recorded as a public, verifiable, and permanent transaction. Donors can see exactly where their contributions are going, and organizations can prove that funds were received and properly accounted for.
